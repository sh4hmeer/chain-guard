# ChainGuardia 🛡️

**Real-time supply chain security monitoring with AI-powered vulnerability intelligence**

ChainGuardia is a comprehensive application security platform that helps organizations track their software inventory and identify vulnerabilities in real-time. Built with React, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Google Gemini AI.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 **Real-Time Security Intelligence** (NEW!)
- **Multi-Source Threat Feed** - Aggregates from NIST NVD, CISA KEV, and GitHub Security Advisories
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Google Gemini analyzes vulnerabilities and provides actionable insights
- **Impact Matching** - Automatically identifies which of your applications are affected
- **Risk Assessment** - Multi-framework severity scoring (CVSS, EPSS, business context)
- **Remediation Guidance** - Specific, prioritized action steps

### 📦 Application Inventory Management


---## Deploy Your Own



## 🎯 The ProblemDeploy your own Vite project with Vercel.



In today's digital workplace, employees use dozens of third-party apps—from productivity tools to niche SaaS services. While these apps increase efficiency, they also open the door to **supply chain attacks**—where attackers compromise trusted vendors or software updates to infiltrate organizations.[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/framework-boilerplates/vite-react&template=vite-react)



Companies often don't know when a system their employees rely on becomes vulnerable. Even if critical vulnerabilities or breaches are disclosed, organizations struggle to track which apps are affected and respond quickly._Live Example: https://vite-react-example.vercel.app_



---### Deploying From Your Terminal



## 💡 The SolutionYou can deploy your new Vite project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):



**ChainGuard** is a monitoring platform that proactively scans and aggregates information about the applications employees use. It cross-checks:```shell

$ vercel

- 🔒 **Security databases** (CVE reports, NVD feeds, vendor security advisories)```

- 📰 **Trusted news outlets** and blogs for emerging supply chain attack reports
- ⚡ **Real-time monitoring** of vulnerabilities affecting your application stack

Whenever an app is flagged as vulnerable, ChainGuard automatically alerts IT/security teams and provides recommended actions.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **App Inventory Integration**: Manually add apps or import via CSV to track the applications your organization uses
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Uses NVD API and security feeds to monitor CVE databases and vendor advisories
3. **Intelligent Matching**: Automatically matches vulnerability reports to apps in your inventory
4. **Actionable Dashboard**: Single pane of glass for CISOs and IT admins to see which vulnerabilities directly impact their workforce

## 🎮 Demo Flow

### Step 1: View Dashboard
- Navigate to the home page to see the security overview
- View statistics on total apps, vulnerabilities, and severity breakdown

### Step 2: Add Applications
- Go to "Applications" tab
- Click "Add App" to manually add applications (Slack, Zoom, GitHub, etc.)
- Or click "Import CSV" to bulk upload applications

**Example CSV format:**
```csv
name,vendor,version,category
Slack,Slack Technologies,4.35.0,Communication
Zoom,Zoom Video Communications,5.15.5,Video Conferencing
GitHub,GitHub,Enterprise Server 3.10,Development
```

### Step 3: Monitor Vulnerabilities
- Go to "Vulnerabilities" tab
- See all CVEs affecting your tracked applications
- Filter by severity level
- Click "Acknowledge" or "Mark Mitigated" to manage vulnerability status

### Step 4: Simulate Alert
- The app comes with mock vulnerabilities for Slack, Zoom, and GitHub
- When you add these apps, you'll see them automatically matched to relevant CVEs
- Dashboard will update with critical alerts

## 🔌 API Integration

### NVD CVE Database

ChainGuard integrates with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API:

```typescript
// Fetch CVEs from NVD
const cves = await fetchCVEsFromNVD('slack', 10);

// Match to your applications
const matched = matchVulnerabilitiesToApps(vulnerabilities, applications);
```

**Note**: NVD API has rate limits (5 requests per 30 seconds without API key). For production use, register for an API key at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Vulnerability Sources

Edit `src/services/vulnerabilityService.ts`:

```typescript
// Add your custom vulnerability source
export const fetchFromCustomSource = async () => {
  // Your implementation
};
```

### Changing Theme Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: { /* your colors */ },
      danger: { /* your colors */ }
    }
  }
}
```
